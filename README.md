Easy to use functions for Node.js to work with mySQL databases.

This is a big work in progress, feel free to check it out it's currently (FEB 08) at a very early development age. There also might be something like this already but if there isn't well then here it is.

The future updates to do:
  * Most common updating, adding, joining functions available with easy to use calls.
  * Linking this to a browser app so that you can instantly write all of your mySQL code for Node.js simply.
  * Pretty much everything, this is just a skeleton and a pipe dream I had.
  
Let me know if this could be useful to you and any features you would like to see!
